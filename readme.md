#Notes
Recreate the Google Homepage (and PUSH IT TO GITHUB) - below are a few tips:
- DONâ€™T BE A PERFECTIONIST!
  - You're just trying to make it look like google.com, not actually function like it.
Things don't have to be spaced exactly the same way to the pixel.
  - Bells & Whistles (like dropdown menus, hover-highlighting, etc.) should be
ignored.
  - If you can't figure something out, it is ok to google it!
  - Start with just putting the main elements on the page (the logo image and search form),
then get them placed horizontally.

  - You can either download the Google logo or link directly to its URL on the web in your <img> tag.
Next, complete the navbar across the top, first building the content and then trying to position it.
Finally, add in the footer, which should be very similar to the top navbar.
In general, do as much on your own as you can before relying on the developer tools (or viewing the page's source code) to help you along
